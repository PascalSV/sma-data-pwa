Add D-DIN font files to this folder so the PWA can serve them locally.

Supported formats (in order of preference):
1. .woff2 (best compression, modern browsers)
2. .woff (good compression, broad support)
3. .otf (OpenType)
4. .ttf (TrueType)

Font files should be named:
- D-DIN.* (regular weight)
- D-DIN-Bold.* (bold weight)

Example: D-DIN.woff2, D-DIN-Bold.otf, etc.
The browser will use the first available format it supports.
