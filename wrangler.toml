# This is the root wrangler.toml - it's kept for reference only
# For deployment, use:
# - api/wrangler.toml for the API service
# - pwa/wrangler.toml for the PWA service
#
# Use npm scripts for easier deployment:
# npm run deploy:api   - Deploy API only
# npm run deploy:pwa   - Deploy PWA only
# npm run deploy       - Deploy both
#
# See README.md for more information
